# Fault Aware Offloading
There are three directories in this project:
1) Finding allocations is a code that uses genetic algorithms to find efficient offloading allocations
2) Fault injection is a code that injects faults into a given allocation.
3) Synthetic workflow graph generator is a code that can generate synthnetic work flow graphs.

We are currently in the process of preparing a more detailed user guide for this project.

Note that you will need to seperately download the MOEA Framework from their github repository.
